This technique can be used to perform zero-interaction account takeovers, uncover new bypasses for web application firewalls, and more.",

I like to hack software I use everyday, because I already know lots of features in advance, so I felt GitHub would be a good target. I started playing with GitHub Desktop and found a way to achieve RCE in OSX. But, guess what? It was out of scope for the event! It’s also out of scope in the normal program, but you can read that “occasionally, exceptional reports are rewarded at our discretion on a case by case basis.”",

The earliest of these tests focused on individual performance and tested occupants on their evacuation speed, sometimes performing the tests “by surprise” as though the fire drill were a real fire. These early tests were more likely to result in injuries to the test-takers than any improvement in survivability. It wasn’t until introducing better protective engineering - wider doors, push bars at exits, firebreaks in construction, lighted exit signs, and so on - that survival rates from building fires began to improve…",
